# TODO

* finish Controls toolkit
* extra controls
  * switch image
  * load your own image
  * make output panel input
  * save as (big) image
* make current state bookmarkable
* FX: invert, vignette
* Make the controls work on phone / tablet

# Thoughts

Speed up rendering of large images by switching to rectangular tiling
once we have enough pattern to repeat.

Make the control points on the triangle have their own semantics:

* red scales only (c.f. red zoom control)
* green scales and rotates
* blue rotates only
